				<p class="bold">My story</p>
				<p>Technopreneurs have taken our world by storm! I want to be part of the group who bridges the gap between existing technologies and market needs to solve the many issues our world is facing now. </p>
				<p> ~ </p>
				<p>I have been in research for the past 3 years in the area of surgical robotics and molecular dynamics. I am starting to explore entrepreneurship by working for small start-up companies. I enjoy working in an environment of constant uncertainties and having to find my way out of them to reach the eventual goal.</p>
				<p> ~ </p>
				<p>I am studying Mechanical Engineering over at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and have a deep passion for computer science. I took a year of exchane to University of California, Berkeley, where I gained valuable exposure to the start-up culture and the passion that drives the silicon valley community for success.</p>

						<p class="bold">Python</p>
						<p>I learnt the ropes of Python programming for 2 years and have grown to appreciate the versatility and simplicity of the language. I used Python as an interface for the da Vinci research kit during my research in surgical robotics and to develop the high level processing unit for a 2 axis gimbal. I am also familiar with image processing libraries in OpenCV, web design framework such as Flask and Python package creation.</p>

					</div>

					<div class="hide paragraph" id="ROS">
						<p class="bold">Robotics Operating System</p>
						<p>I have been a ROS user for 1 year. ROS is a message passing framework that allows communication between the different subunits of a robot. I used ROS for my research in surgical robotics and for a project on autonomous driving vehicle (BARC). I am familiar with catkin package structure and several open sourced packages in motion planning such as Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL), Openrave & Gazebo</p>

					<div class="hide paragraph" id="Solidworks">
						<p class="bold">Solidworks</p>
						<p>I have experience in CAD deign for 1 year. I took a class in CAD design during my exhange programme in Berkeley. I used Solidworks for design, 3D printing and structural analysis. Some of my projects involve designing an aerodynamically optimized shell for the Berkeley Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) and a miniature Windmill.</p>

						<p class="bold">Matlab</p>
						<p>I have been a Matlab user for 3 years. I used Matlab mostly for data processing & system modelling. Key projects that I did include developing a Finite Element model for wave propagation, signal processing for spatial aliasing of underwater waves, big data analysis of molecular dynamic simulation results and Gaussian process classification for traffic density analysis.</p>

					<div class="hide paragraph" id="Arduino">
						<p class="bold">Arduino</p>
						<p>I have been prototyping for 3 years using Arduino with C programming environment. My goal is to enter the Maker community space, using sensors with the cloud to develop solutions for everyday problems. Some of my projects involve a low level servo control for 2 axis gimbal, an automatic door opener using finger print sensing and the development of an IoT inspired smart home.
